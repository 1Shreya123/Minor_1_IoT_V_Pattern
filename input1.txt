Flow of events- there is a regular flow of events it starts with the user selecting his mode of food which is online or offline. If he has selected the online mode he performs with the creation of account, then logging into the account, following with the surfing of the menu provided, further he finalises his cart with the items he wants to order, he is given a chance to preview his order, further he is asked to select the mode of payment i.e. online or offline. If it is online mode of payment it is made that ways. If it is offline mode then the cash is given to the delivery boy. 
In case of person visiting the restaurant he is supposed to look for the empty table in case he receives one he orders his food upon looking up the menu provided to him. He further makes the billing. Q4 Describe the following terms of state diagram: event, guard condition, transition, state and effect.
State – This defines the abstraction of attribute and behaviour of an object at a specific time e.g.:- washing machine, this can have two states idle state and washing state. There might occur events that may or may not change the state of the machine. 
 Event – It is the occurrence at a point in time, also called as external motivation, if there happens to be an event then there might occur a change in state. For e.g.:- if in the case of washing machine, the time out event occurs then the machine stops, i.e. a change in state occurs or in case of alarm clock if the button is clicked the alarm clock stops. The change in the state is instantaneous. Event can be concurrent event, i.e. sequence of occurrence does not matter in the system. 
Transition – instantaneous change in the state is known as transition, i.e. the change is discrete and the transition is instantaneous, this is triggered by an event. Origin and target state of the transition may be different, but they can also be same. Eg:- in case of a dial pad, we start with a different dial tone and when we dial a number we have a different tone. 
Guard condition- This is a Boolean expression that must be true for transition to occur, this is checked only once. If the expression is true only then the transition can be fired else it cannot be fired. For eg:- if the temperature if high (condition) put on your gloves(transition to the next state).
Effects - These can be defined as the reference to the behaviour executed in response to an event. They are performed upon a transition, entry to or exit from a state or some event within a state. They are defined using notation “/”.

Q5 Describe the types of concurrency in state diagram with suitable example.
Concurrency – when we have multiple objects, they change their state independent from one other, and define abstraction of the states, this is called concurrency.
Aggregation concurrency – we can say that we have an collection of state diagram and from each part an aggregate state is defined from the combination of which the entire state is defined. It is shown with the help of and relationship. For e.g.:- car, a car has several components like accelerator, ignition, brakes etc. Ignition is turned on when keys are put in. they can be turned off when keys are released.  Transmission has its own changes. Similarly acceleration has its own sub state diagram showing on and off. In case of brakes too if it is on then car stops, if off it moves. We can say that a combination of these activities makes the car. Basically sub states work together to make a combined state. 
Concurrency within an object – This means that sometimes an object can be partitioned and each attribute has its own sub diagram and those sub-states are happening concurrently. Dotted lines are used in order to represent two concurrently occurring activities. For e.g.:- if we take the case of an auction then three activities namely getting bid, evaluating and accepting happen concurrently to checking and authorized.

Effects - These can be defined as the reference to the behaviour executed in response to an event. They are performed upon a transition, entry to or exit from a state or some event within a state. They are defined using notation “/”.
Q5 Describe the types of concurrency in state diagram with suitable example.
Concurrency – when we have multiple objects, they change their state independent from one other, and define abstraction of the states, this is called concurrency.
Aggregation concurrency – we can say that we have an collection of state diagram and from each part an aggregate state is defined from the combination of which the entire state is defined. It is shown with the help of and relationship. For e.g.:- car, a car has several components like accelerator, ignition, brakes etc. Ignition is turned on when keys are put in. they can be turned off when keys are released.  Transmission has its own changes. Similarly acceleration has its own sub state diagram showing on and off. In case of brakes too if it is on then car stops, if off it moves. We can say that a combination of these activities makes the car. Basically sub states work together to make a combined state. 
Concurrency within an object – This means that sometimes an object can be partitioned and each attribute has its own sub diagram and those sub-states are happening concurrently. Dotted lines are used in order to represent two concurrently occurring activities. For e.g.:- if we take the case of an auction then three activities namely getting bid, evaluating and accepting happen concurrently to checking and authorized. 
Q4 Describe the following terms of state diagram: event, guard condition, transition, state and effect.
State – This defines the abstraction of attribute and behaviour of an object at a specific time e.g.:- washing machine, this can have two states idle state and washing state. There might occur events that may or may not change the state of the machine. 
 Event – It is the occurrence at a point in time, also called as external motivation, if there happens to be an event then there might occur a change in state. For e.g.:- if in the case of washing machine, the time out event occurs then the machine stops, i.e. a change in state occurs or in case of alarm clock if the button is clicked the alarm clock stops. The change in the state is instantaneous. Event can be concurrent event, i.e. sequence of occurrence does not matter in the system. 
Transition – instantaneous change in the state is known as transition, i.e. the change is discrete and the transition is instantaneous, this is triggered by an event. Origin and target state of the transition may be different, but they can also be same. Eg:- in case of a dial pad, we start with a different dial tone and when we dial a number we have a different tone. 
Guard condition- This is a Boolean expression that must be true for transition to occur, this is checked only once. If the expression is true only then the transition can be fired else it cannot be fired. For eg:- if the temperature if high (condition) put on your gloves(transition to the next state).
Effects - These can be defined as the reference to the behaviour executed in response to an event. They are performed upon a transition, entry to or exit from a state or some event within a state. They are defined using notation “/”.
